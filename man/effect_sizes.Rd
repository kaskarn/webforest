\title{Effect Sizes with Varying Precision (Stress Test Dataset)}
\format{
A data frame with 20 rows and 12 variables:
\describe{
\item{study}{Study or site name}
\item{region}{Geographic region: North America, Europe, or Asia Pacific}
\item{outcome}{Outcome type: Primary, Secondary, or Exploratory}
\item{treatment}{Treatment arm: Drug A, Drug B, or Combination}
\item{phase}{Trial phase: Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3}
\item{n}{Sample size}
\item{hr}{Hazard ratio point estimate}
\item{lower}{Lower bound of 95 percent confidence interval}
\item{upper}{Upper bound of 95 percent confidence interval}
\item{se}{Standard error (log scale)}
\item{significant}{Logical: whether CI excludes 1.0}
\item{direction}{Effect direction: Favors Treatment or Favors Control}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data designed to test edge cases in forest plot rendering.
}
\usage{
effect_sizes
}
\description{
A dataset designed to stress test forest plot axis rendering and subgroup
splitting logic. Contains studies with widely varying confidence interval
widths, from highly precise large trials to exploratory studies with CIs
that extend far beyond typical axis limits.
}
\details{
This dataset is useful for testing:
\itemize{
\item Axis range calculation with extreme CI bounds
\item CI clipping and arrow indicators
\item \code{split_by} / \code{plot_by} with multiple grouping variables
\item Edge cases: very wide CIs, null effects, extreme effect sizes
}
}
\examples{
data(effect_sizes)

# Basic plot - note how axis adapts to varying CI widths
forest_plot(effect_sizes,
            point = "hr", lower = "lower", upper = "upper",
            label = "study", scale = "log")

# Split by region to test subgroup navigation
forest_plot(effect_sizes,
            point = "hr", lower = "lower", upper = "upper",
            label = "study", scale = "log", split_by = "region")

# Split by multiple variables for hierarchical navigation
